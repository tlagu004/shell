Instructions for Programming Assignmeng 1
1. Login to FIU Ocelot or Linux Terminal
2. Add necessary files and the makefile to the directory
3. type in make (note to self: it runs the Makefile)
4. Start running shell.c by typing in ./osh

History commands
Example: osh> ls pwd date !!

Redirection commands
Example: osh> ls > out.txt (note to self: redirects output to file)
Example: osh> sort < in.txt (note to self: redirects input from file)

Pipe commands
