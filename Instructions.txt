Instructions for Programming Assignment 1
1. Login to FIU Ocelot or Linux Terminal
2. Make sure Makefile and shell.c are in the current directory.Add other included files from ZIP file
3. type in make in the terminal (note to self: it runs the Makefile)
4. Start running shell.c by typing in ./osh
5. You should see osh> (start typing commands anywhere after)

Features Implemented in this Shell include Core Functionality & Additional Features:
Core Functionality
Process Creation and Execution
Command Parsing
History Feature
Input/Output Redirection
Pipes

Additional Features
Job Control
Aliases
Command Completion
Signal Handling


Example Test Cases I used in demo:

Basic commands
Example: osh> ls (list the files)
Example: osh> pwd (print working directory)

Background commands
Example: osh> sleep 10 & (runs sleep in background)

History commands
Example: osh> ls !! pwd !! (lists files, repeats, prints working directory, repeats)

Redirection commands
Example: osh> ls > out.txt (note to self: redirects output to file)
Example: osh> sort < in.txt (note to self: redirects input from file)

Pipe commands
Example: osh> ls -l | less (sends ls output to less)

Signal Handling (New Feature)
Example: Press CTRL+C (SIGINT Catch; Does not exit)
Example: Press CTRL+Z (SIGTSTP; does not suspend)


Alias
Example: osh> alias lst=ls -l
Example: osh> alias lst ./guest (alias with params)

Job Control Termination
Example: osh> sleep 100 & (start background job)
Example: osh> kill PID (terminates job)

Command Completion
Example: osh> g? (shows directory hints for 'g')
Example: osh> i? (shows directory hints for 'i')


Exit command
Example: osh> exit
