# UNIX Shell

This project is a custom UNIX Shell interface implemented in C. The program mimics a standard command-line interpreter (like bash) by accepting user commands and executing them in separate processes.

<!-- ## Key Features
* **Process Management**: Uses `fork()`, `execvp()`, and `wait()` to run commands.
* **Background Execution**: Supports the `&` suffix to run processes concurrently.
* **History Feature**: Use `!!` to re-run the most recent command.
* **I/O Redirection**: 
    * `>`: Redirects output to a file (e.g., `ls > out.txt`).
    * `<`: Redirects input from a file (e.g., `sort < in.txt`).
* **Pipes**: Supports IPC between two commands using `|` (e.g., `ls -l | less`). -->

 **Compile**: Use the provided Makefile or gcc.
